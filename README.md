qdash: A port of lodash to q / kdb+

"Because the author needed to learn both q and lodash, and he figured this would
be a good way to kill two birds with one stone."

Documentation will be expanded as the project gets underway

Comes with pre-built qdash.q for \loading into q.

To rebuild qdash.q from /src:
1. npm install (one time only; requires nodeJS)
2. gulp
